# GMR HEALTH-CARE CHATBOT 🤖💉

GMR HEALTH-CARE CHATBOT is an intelligent conversational AI model designed to provide health information, medical assistance, and appointment scheduling through a chat interface.

## Technologies Used 🚀

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Framework:** Django
- **Libraries:** nltk, numpy, torch
- **Model Architectures:** RNN, BRNN, LSTM, BLSTM, Neural Net, BERT

## Chatbot Operation 🤔

The chatbot operation involves natural language processing to understand user queries and provide appropriate responses. It supports various medical queries, health information retrieval, and appointment scheduling.

### Chatbot Models 🤖

The project includes the implementation of various models for natural language processing:

- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- BRNN (Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- BLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)
- Neural Net
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Registration and Login:**
   - Users can register for an account by providing their details.
   - After registration, users receive a confirmation email to activate their account.
   - Login using the registered credentials.

2. **Chatbot Interaction:**
   - Access the chatbot interface on the home page.
   - Enter text in the chatbox to interact with the chatbot.
   - The chatbot provides responses based on the implemented models.

3. **Make Appointment:**
   - Navigate to the "Contact" section to schedule appointments.
   - Fill in the required details, including Gmail ID, subject, and messages.
   - Submit the form to request an appointment.

## Project Structure 📁

The project structure includes Django views for user registration, login, chatbot interaction, and appointment scheduling.

- **views.py:** Contains functions for user registration, login, chatbot interaction, and appointment scheduling.
- **tokens.py:** Token generation for user activation.
- **email_confirmation.html:** Email template for account activation.
- **sent.html:** Confirmation page after submitting an appointment request.

## Dependencies 🌟
